1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

    I think the most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is dealing with the transactional data. 

2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

    I think we would like to investigate the relationship between the transactional data and the income data to make a model that generates the credit score.
        
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

    Currently, our approach of cleaning the memos includes getting rid of some common words where we think are unnecessary. I think we can try to use some other techniques to clean the memos. For example, we can use the `nltk` package to remove the stop words.

4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

    I think we can use some other classification models to predict the category of the transaction.
